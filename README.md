# Kulupu era transitions

Kulupu protocol upgrades are split between eras. Each era, a new
genesis block is generated, taking previous era's complete state
information.

## Era 0 to Era 1

Era 0 contains two protocol configurations, **Irontown**, the genesis
block, and **Slag Ravine**, the first Kulupu hard fork.

In the next hard fork **Swamp Bottom**, we're going to transit from
era 0 to era 1.
